# The Nico Programming Language

A fast, safe, statically-typed, and compiled programming language designed for general-purpose programming.
Created for fun by Brian Magnuson (yes, I'm doing this again).

The name "Nico" does not refer to any particular person or thing. If you want a meaning, it can be interpreted as a portmanteau of "neo" and "pico", meaning "new" and "small" respectively.

Nico philosophy:
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Versatility is better than simplicity.
- But the basics should stay simple.
- Readability counts.
- Consistency is golden.
- Safe by default.
